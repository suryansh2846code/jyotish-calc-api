Planetary aspect (Graha Drishti) calculator.

In Vedic astrology, planets cast aspects (drishti) on other planets and
houses. Every planet aspects the 7th house from its position (the "universal"
aspect). Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Rahu, and Ketu have additional "special"
aspects on specific houses.

HOW ASPECTS WORK:
    1. Determine which house (1-12) the aspecting planet occupies.
    2. Look up the house offsets the planet aspects (from GRAHA_DRISHTI).
       An offset of 7 means "the 7th house counted from the planet's house."
    3. Compute the aspected house number:
           aspected_house = ((planet_house - 1 + offset - 1) % 12) + 1
       This wraps correctly around the 12-house cycle.
    4. Check if any planets occupy the aspected house.
    5. The 7th-house aspect is the universal aspect (is_special=False).
       All other offsets (Mars 4th/8th, Jupiter 5th/9th, Saturn 3rd/10th)
       are special aspects (is_special=True).
       Rahu/Ketu: only the universal 7th aspect per BPHS (no special aspects).

    >>> for a in aspects:
    ...     print(f"{a.aspecting_planet.name} → house {a.aspected_house}")
