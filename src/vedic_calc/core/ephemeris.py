Thin wrapper around pyswisseph (Swiss Ephemeris).

THIS IS THE ONLY MODULE IN VEDIC-CALC THAT IMPORTS PYSWISSEPH.
Everything else works with plain longitude values (floats).

WHY THIS BOUNDARY EXISTS:
    The Swiss Ephemeris has a complex C-style API. By isolating it here,
    the rest of the codebase is pure Python arithmetic on floats — easy
    to test, understand, and (if ever needed) swap to a different engine.

WHAT IS THE SWISS EPHEMERIS?
    A high-precision astronomical calculation library, accurate to
    < 0.001 arcseconds. It's based on NASA JPL's Development Ephemeris
    (DE431) and has been the industry standard since 1997. Every major
    astrology software (JHora, AstroSage, etc.) uses it under the hood.

    It provides planetary positions in the "tropical" zodiac (aligned with
    seasons). We subtract the ayanamsa to convert to the "sidereal" zodiac
    (aligned with fixed stars), which is what Vedic astrology uses.

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
    - All longitudes are in degrees (0° to 360°) along the ecliptic
    - 0° = the First Point of Aries (tropical) or the start of Aries
      constellation (sidereal)
    - Longitude increases counter-clockwise when viewed from north

TIME SYSTEM:
    The Swiss Ephemeris uses Julian Day numbers (JD) — a continuous count
    of days since January 1, 4713 BCE. This avoids calendar complexities
    (leap years, calendar reforms, etc.). All times must be in Universal
    Time (UT/UTC), not local time.

    The ayanamsa is the angular difference between the tropical zodiac

    Earth's axial precession. Approximate values:

    CALCULATION STEPS:
        1. Call Swiss Ephemeris to get the tropical (Western) longitude

        3. Subtract ayanamsa to convert to sidereal (Vedic) longitude:
           sidereal = (tropical - ayanamsa) % 360
        4. Check if the planet's daily motion is negative (= retrograde)

    RETROGRADE:
        Planets sometimes appear to move backward in the sky (an illusion
        caused by Earth overtaking slower outer planets, or inner planets
        lapping Earth). This is called "retrograde" motion and is considered
        significant in astrology. We detect it by checking if the planet's
        daily speed in longitude is negative.

    SPECIAL CASES:
        - Rahu: Always considered retrograde in Vedic astrology (the lunar
          nodes naturally move backward through the zodiac)
        - Ketu: Always exactly 180° from Rahu, always retrograde

        jd: Julian Day number (in UT).

    WHAT IS THE ASCENDANT?
        The ascendant (or "lagna" in Sanskrit) is the zodiac degree that
        was rising on the eastern horizon at the exact moment and place
        of birth. It changes roughly every 2 hours (since the Earth
        rotates 360° in 24 hours, and there are 12 signs).

        The ascendant is considered the most important point in a Vedic
        birth chart — it determines which sign becomes your 1st house,
        and all other houses follow from there.

    WHY LOCATION MATTERS:
        Unlike planetary positions (which are the same worldwide at any
        given moment), the ascendant depends on your geographic latitude
        and longitude because it's about what's on YOUR horizon.
