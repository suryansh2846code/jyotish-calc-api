Constants for Vedic astrology calculations.

This module defines all the fundamental enumerations and lookup tables used
throughout the library: planets, signs, nakshatras, and their relationships.

All data comes from classical Vedic astrology texts, primarily:
  - BPHS: Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra (the foundational text of Vedic astrology,
    attributed to sage Parashara, ~1500 BCE). Think of it as the "specification
    document" for Vedic astrology.
  - Surya Siddhanta: An ancient Indian astronomical text (~400 CE) that provides
    the mathematical models for planetary motion.

TERMINOLOGY FOR NEWCOMERS:
  - "Graha" = planet (literally "that which seizes/influences")
  - "Rashi" = zodiac sign (a 30° segment of the sky)
  - "Nakshatra" = lunar mansion (a 13.33° segment, there are 27)
  - "Ayanamsa" = the angular offset between Western and Vedic zodiacs
  - "Dasha" = planetary period (a time-based prediction system)

# Vedic astrology uses 9 "planets" (Navagraha = "nine planets"):
#   - 7 visible celestial bodies: Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn
#   - 2 lunar nodes: Rahu (north node) and Ketu (south node)
#
# The lunar nodes are not physical bodies — they are the two points where the
# Moon's orbital plane crosses the Earth's orbital plane (the ecliptic). These
# points are where eclipses can occur, which is why ancient astronomers
# considered them important.
#
# Rahu = ascending node (where Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic)
# Ketu = descending node (always exactly opposite Rahu, i.e., 180° away)

# Signs (Rashis)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The zodiac is a 360° band of sky through which the Sun, Moon, and planets
# appear to move. It is divided into 12 equal segments of 30° each, called
# signs (rashis).
#
# IMPORTANT — TROPICAL vs SIDEREAL:
#   Western astrology uses the "tropical" zodiac, anchored to the seasons
#   (0° Aries = spring equinox). Vedic astrology uses the "sidereal" zodiac,
#   anchored to the fixed stars. Due to Earth's axial precession (a slow
#   wobble over ~26,000 years), these two zodiacs have drifted apart by ~24°.
#   This drift is called the "ayanamsa" (see Ayanamsa section below).
#
#   In practice: if Western astrology says your Sun is in Aries, Vedic
#   astrology might say it's in Pisces (shifted back by ~24°).
#
# Each sign has a "lord" (ruling planet) that is said to influence the
# qualities of that sign. Source: BPHS Chapter 4, Verse 3.

# Nakshatras (Lunar Mansions)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Nakshatras are a uniquely Vedic concept — they divide the zodiac into 27
# segments (instead of 12 signs). Each nakshatra spans 13°20' (13.3333°).
#
# WHY 27?
#   The Moon takes ~27.3 days to orbit the Earth (sidereal month). Ancient
#   Indian astronomers divided the sky into 27 segments so the Moon passes
#   through roughly one nakshatra per day. This makes the Moon's nakshatra
#   a natural "daily clock" in the sky.
#
# PADAS (quarters):
#   Each nakshatra is further divided into 4 equal parts called "padas"
#   (quarters), each spanning 3°20' (3.3333°). There are 27 × 4 = 108
#   padas in total. The number 108 is sacred in Hinduism.
#
# WHY NAKSHATRAS MATTER:
#   - The Moon's nakshatra at birth determines your Vimsottari dasha
#     starting period (a major predictive tool — see dasha module)
#   - Each nakshatra has a ruling planet (used for dasha calculation)
#   - Nakshatras provide finer granularity than signs (13.3° vs 30°)
#
# Formula: nakshatra_number = floor(longitude / 13.3333) + 1
# Formula: pada = floor((longitude % 13.3333) / 3.3333) + 1

#   4. After it ends, the next planet in the sequence takes over
#   5. The sequence repeats: Ketu→Venus→Sun→Moon→Mars→Rahu→Jupiter→Saturn→Mercury
#
# Each planet's period has a fixed duration (in years):
#   Ketu=7, Venus=20, Sun=6, Moon=10, Mars=7, Rahu=18, Jupiter=16, Saturn=19, Mercury=17
#   Total: 7+20+6+10+7+18+16+19+17 = 120 years

# Ayanamsa modes
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT IS AYANAMSA?
#
# The Earth's axis wobbles slowly (like a spinning top) over a ~26,000-year
# cycle. This is called "precession of the equinoxes." Because of this:
#
#   - The spring equinox point (0° Aries in Western/tropical astrology)
#     slowly drifts backward through the constellations
#   - As of 2024, it has drifted ~24° from where the actual constellation
#     Aries begins
#
# Western astrology ignores this drift (tropical zodiac = tied to seasons).
# Vedic astrology accounts for it (sidereal zodiac = tied to fixed stars).
#
# The "ayanamsa" is the angular difference between the two systems:
#   sidereal_longitude = tropical_longitude - ayanamsa
#
# Different scholars have slightly different values for the ayanamsa
# (they disagree on the exact "zero point" of the sidereal zodiac).
# The most common in India is Lahiri (~24° in 2024).
#
# Source: Indian Calendar Reform Committee (1956) for Lahiri.

# The integer values below correspond to Swiss Ephemeris ayanamsa mode
# constants (passed to swe.set_sid_mode()).
